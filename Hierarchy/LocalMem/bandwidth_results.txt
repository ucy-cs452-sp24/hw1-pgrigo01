Intel(R) Memory Latency Checker - v3.11
Command line parameters: --bandwidth_matrix 

Using buffer size of 100.000MiB/thread for reads and an additional 100.000MiB/thread for writes
*** Unable to modify prefetchers (try executing 'modprobe msr')
*** So, enabling random access for latency measurements
Measuring Memory Bandwidths between nodes within system 
Bandwidths are in MB/sec (1 MB/sec = 1,000,000 Bytes/sec)
Using all the threads from each core if Hyper-threading is enabled
Using Read-only traffic type
