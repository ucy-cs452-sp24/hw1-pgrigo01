##Panagiotis Grigoriou

The experiment was conducted on Cloud machine cluster c220g5.

##Latency (us)
The Local Dram latency was measured to be the lowest of the bunch at 0.0962 followed by the remote DRAM latency which was 57us  and then by the Local Disk at 189.3 and finally the Remote Disk at 246.3.

##Bandwidth (MB/s)
In terms of bandwidth that i found for the Local DRAM was 48665.9MB/s.The Local Disk bandwidth was measured to be 284MB/s.For the Remote DRAM i found the value to be 432.5MB/s.And finally the Remote Disk bandwidth was the same as the Local Disk which is 284MB/s.

##Capacity (GB)
The capacities i found where the following:
Local DRAM: 196.6 GB
Local Disk: 480 GB
For the remote disk and remote DRAM since I can't calculate the Remote DRAM and Remote Disk i have the same values in my graph for  Local DRAM and DISK

##Conclusion 
The conclusion I have for this experiement is that in general the DRAM is way faster in terms of latency and it has a lot more bandwidth than the DISK so it is best if we use DRAM more frequently.
